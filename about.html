            <h2>Conan characters</h2>
            <p>Detective Conan, also known as Case Closed, features a captivating array of characters that contribute to the enduring popularity of this Japanese manga and anime series. At its center is Shinichi Kudo, a brilliant high school detective who, after being poisoned, is transformed into a child and adopts the alias Conan Edogawa. His unwavering determination and sharp deductive skills make him the series' protagonist.

                Alongside Conan are a host of intriguing characters, including his childhood friend and love interest, Ran Mouri, who is an accomplished karate practitioner. Ran's father, Kogoro Mouri, is a bumbling yet well-meaning private detective whose cases often intertwine with Conan's investigations.
                
                The Tokyo Metropolitan Police force plays a significant role, with characters like Inspector Megure and Detective Sato assisting Conan in solving complex crimes. Furthermore, the mysterious Black Organization, led by the enigmatic Vermouth, adds an element of danger and intrigue to the series as they pursue their own shadowy agendas.
                
                In the realm of adversaries-turned-allies, we have Kaito Kuroba, also known as Kaito Kid, a charismatic and skilled phantom thief who occasionally crosses paths with Conan, showcasing his own brand of cunning heists.
                
                Akai Shuichi, on the other hand, is a former FBI agent with a complex and mysterious past, known for his alias, Shuichi Akai. He is a key player in the ongoing narrative, often working alongside Conan to uncover hidden truths and solve intricate cases.
                
                The cast extends to Conan's classmates, the Detective Boys, and various recurring characters, each with their own quirks and abilities, contributing to the rich tapestry of Detective Conan's world. It's this diverse and well-developed ensemble of characters that keeps fans eagerly following each mystery, making Detective Conan a beloved and enduring series in the world of detective fiction.</p>
